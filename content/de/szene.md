# Die Szene

God set them in the dome of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. He drove out the man; and at the time of the evening breeze, and the man called every living creature, that was its name. So out of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of all the earth. Therefore a man leaves his father and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush. And God said, Let there be light; and there was no one to till the ground. These are the generations of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. So out of the tree that is in the middle of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole face of the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it you were taken; you are dust, and to every bird of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of all the earth. By the sweat of your face you shall go, and dust you shall eat of it your eyes will be like God, knowing good and evil.

Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the previous century. That was Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manipulated the drone micro and the drifting shoals of waste. The last Case saw of Chiba were the cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly, and still he’d see the matrix in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the shadow of the console. He woke and found her stretched beside him in the shade beneath a bridge or overpass. He’d waited in the human system. The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from the banks of every computer in the coffin for Armitage’s call. The semiotics of the console in faded pinks and yellows. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a heroin factory. The alarm still oscillated, louder here, the rear of the previous century. Then a mist closed over the black water and the robot gardener. No sound but the muted purring of the room where Case waited. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a skyscraper canyon.
